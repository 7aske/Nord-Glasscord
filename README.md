This is a modification of AryToNeX's Glasscord: https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord.
It simply combines several themes and makes them work with Glasscord to conform to the Nord Theme color palette:
https://www.nordtheme.com/

If you're seeing this and have no idea what's happening, follow the instructions on the above stated Glasscord Github repository page. Install Bandage BD, then Glasscord's .asar file, then instead of installing Glasscord's theme.css files, install the one in this repository (to the folder C:\Users\[name]\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes\).

Only tested with BandagedBD. Use at your own risk, though I haven't run into any problems. Good luck, and please enjoy!
