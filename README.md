This is a modification of AryToNeX's Glasscord: https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord.
It simply combines several themes and makes them work with Glasscord to conform to the Nord Theme color palette:
https://www.nordtheme.com/

INSTRUCTIONS:
Start by installing BandagedBD: https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases. Then, follow the instructions on the Glasscord page (scroll down): https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord to install JUST THE .asar FILE for Glasscord (found under releases). Then, INSTEAD OF installing Glasscord's discord_example.theme.css file, download nord-glasscord.theme.css from this repository/fork to your BetterDiscord/themes folder (themes folder can be opened from the Themes page of your BandagedBD Discord settings). Finally, enable it in the Themes page of BandagedBD, and enjoy!

I also recommend the https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/EditChannels plugin to customize channel text color.

Only tested with BandagedBD. Use at your own risk, though I haven't run into any problems. Good luck, and please enjoy!
